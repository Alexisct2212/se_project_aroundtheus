# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

Hello, today we are going to talk about the project and describe it, to begin with the page is responsive to do this effect I use grid, grid helps keep the objects in a specific place without collapsing as much as flexbox would. The importance of using sematic tags is to be able to make the code more readable when you want to change or fix the code, the reason why the normalize.css file is placed at the top is because the visual code reads the code below. above. above. So the codes with the greatest importance or relevance usually go first. The alternatives are arial and sans-serif, the biggest challenge was how to make the design look like the one shown in figma and apart from figma it does not show the gap or margin that the elements have.
